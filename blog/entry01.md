### Chossing my Tool

The tool I chose for my Freedom Project this time around is called Godot. When given the liberty to do something that we wanted, I thought of making another game, which would hopefully be better than the last one made from my previous Freedom Project. From the list, it appeared there were a few options for this, but two of these were pointed out by Mr. Mueller. That was [Unity](https://unity.com/) and Godot, both were relatively good for creating games, so those two caught my eye. Picking one of the two was kind of easy because it was said that Godot was more up to date with their updates than Unity and seemed to be easier to use.
