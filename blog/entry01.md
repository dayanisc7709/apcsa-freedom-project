### Chossing my Tool

The tool I chose for my Freedom Project this time around is called Godot. When given the liberty to do something that we wanted, I thought of making another game, which would hopefully be better than the last one made from my previous Freedom Project. From the list, it appeared there were a few options for this, but two of these were pointed out by Mr. Mueller. That was [Unity](https://unity.com/) and Godot, both were relatively good for creating games, so those two caught my eye. Picking one of the two was kind of easy because it was said that Godot was more up to date with their updates than Unity and seemed to be easier to use. My mind was locked onto these two, so I made Godot my main tool and Unity would be my backup incase that didn't go well.

# How I've tinkered with my tool

There hasn't been as much coding as I had expected, since I'm only just starting out with getting to learn the basics. So far, what I've been able to do is get a grasp on how the sprites work and how to import them and other stuff beyond it. I wanted to use my own art for this project, but since I'm just starting to figure things out, I decided I would use a sprite sheet found somewhere online. With that, I started to learn more about sprites in this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) Within that video, I learned that nodes are basically how everything in the games are made and are used everywhere. When importing the sheet, I also found that in order for there to be an animation, you need a node for this and the sheet has to be cut up into pieces, so that it knows what pieces will be used for the animation loop and how long.

So as seen from above, this was when I had gotten the idle animation down. I also realized another thing, when counting the pieces, it was very similar to Java where it'll start at zero instead of one, which had confused me initialy because the amount for this loop was 13 pieces, but with it starting at zero, it ended on 12 pieces. I also saw that Sprites will need collision shapes because if it ever bumps into something, a problem arises where it won't have anything happen, so objects will just pass through one another. It was also said it didn't need to be that accurate, so it ended up just being a circle in the middle of the sprite.

# Engineering Design Process
I think right now I'm at the second stage of my EDP process, since I've just now started to get a grasp of my tool. I've decided what I'm going to do for my tool that I've picked, but now I need to do some research and how I'll be able to do the project idea that I want to do.
